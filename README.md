Ultimate Webshots Converter 2 (Qt5.4)
=====================================
This is a fork of the original at https://github.com/setaou/uwc2/.
This version is now compiling with Qt5.4 and using QtCreator (mingw C++11).

I've added a about dialog, and a export webshots archive feature.
Not all original (1.6) features are implemented yet.


Old info:

Ultimate Webshots Converter (also known under the short name "UWC"), is a Webshots pictures converter (see www.webshots.com).
It is able to show and save into JPEG files the pictures contained in the following files : 

 * .WBC and .WBP - Webshots Collections
 * .WBZ - Downloaded Webshots pictures
 * .WB1 and .WBD - Webshots pictures

This is the second version, a complete rewrite in C++/Qt, but it has never been finished.

It uses the cWebshots classes to handle the file formats.
