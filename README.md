Ultimate Webshots Converter 2
=============================

Ultimate Webshots Converter (also known under the short name "UWC"), is a Webshots pictures converter (see www.webshots.com).
It is able to show and save into JPEG files the pictures contained in the following files : 

 * .WBC and .WBP - Webshots Collections
 * .WBZ - Downloaded Webshots pictures
 * .WB1 and .WBD - Webshots pictures

This is the second version, a complete rewrite in C++/Qt, but it has never been finished.

It uses the cWebshots classes to handle the file formats.
